\section{Steam-Methane Reforming}

In steam-methane reforming high-temperature steam, 1300$^{\circ}$F to 1800$^{\circ}$F, under 3-25 bar pressure reacts with methane in the presence of a catalyst to produce hydrogen.

Natural gas is the lowest cost alternative. Natural gas provides 95\% of the hydrogen used in refineries and chemical industry \cite{harstein_arthur_hydrogen_2003}.

hydrogen production consumes most of the energy in the endothermic steam methane reforming reaction. at 800-1000 $^{\circ}$C,
\begin{equation}
CH_4 + H_2O \rightarrow CO + 3H_2, \Delta H^{\circ}_{R, 298K} = 206.1 kJ/mol
\end{equation}
.
The effluents go through a shift reactor with steam at 350-550$^{\circ}$C, to eliminate carbon monoxide and maximize hydrogen yield through the exothermic \gls{WGS}: 
\begin{equation}
CO + H_2O \rightarrow CO_2 + H_2, \Delta H^{\circ}_{R, 298K} = -41.2 kJ/mol
\end{equation}
.

\section{Central Hydrogen Production from Natural Gas without CO$_2$ Sequestration}

Desulfurized natural gas feedstock reacts with process steam over a nickel based catalyst inside of a system of high alloy steel tubes. The process is endothermic, and the metallurgy of the tubes limits the reaction temperature to 760 to 926 $^{\circ}$C.



\section{Syngas}
Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is a catalyzed chemical reactor in which synthesis gas (syngas), a mixture of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2) becomes a gas, liquid, and solid hydrocarbons \cite{speight_fischertropsch_2014}. This process i

\section{Exelon}

On going project that aims to provide a basis for converting baseload nuclear plants into hybrid plants that produce hydrogen.
Increases in variable wind and solar energy and low-cost natural gas impact baseload nuclear power generation stations make necessary a new operating paradigm for these plants.
Hydrogen production with nuclear energy may increase the plant revenue \cite{otgonbaatar_merchant_2019}.

\section{Hydrogen Storage}
There are three basic storage methods \cite{carriveau_hydrogen_2016}:
compressed hydrogen gas, liquid hydrogen, and solid storage of hydrogen. 
The first two consist of changing hydrogen's physical state in gaseous or liquid form.
The third method includes the following categories: physisorption in porous materials, absorbed on interstitial sites in a host metal, complex compounds, and metals and complexes with water.

The traditional hydrogen storage facilities are complicated, and liquid hydrogen requires a refrigeration unit, adding energy costs, and a resultant of 40\% loss in energy content \cite{carriveau_hydrogen_2016}.

\section{MTD Hydrogen Buses}

Fuel cell buses use a battery-dominant hybrid architecture where the batteries are large enough to handle all vehicle performance needs.
The fuel cell, Figure \ref{fig:nf2} acts like a continuous battery charger to extend the range of the vehicle.
The Xcelsior CHARGE H2 can travel up to 350 miles on a single refueling \cite{new_flyer_xcelsior_2019}.

\section{Different types of fertilizers}
\cite{hugh_savoy_fertilizers_2009}

\section{Nitrogen Fertilizers}
Nitrogen fertilizers represent a major industry worldwide. Nitrogen fertilizers include many types of liquid and solid products, among which the most common ones are ammonia, ammonium nitrate, and urea \cite{guichon_valves_nitrogen_2020}.

A reaction of nitrogen from the air with hydrogen from natural gas at high pressure and temperature produces ammonia by means of the Haber process (200-300 bars and 450$^{\circ}$C).

For ease of handling, other types of fertilizers are preferable, see Figure \ref{fig:nitrof}. Another important fertilizer is the urea. A reaction of ammonia with carbon dioxide produces it. A combination between ammonium nitrate and urea produces another fertilizer called urea ammonium nitrate (UAN).

\end{figure}

The Haber-Bosch process constitutes the dominant route for ammonia production.
Gaseous N$_2$ and H$_2$ react at elevated pressures (>100 bar) and temperatures ($\~$500$^{\circ}$C) in presence of an Fe-based catalyst \cite{kyriakou_electrochemical_2020}.
Nowadays, ammonia synthesis consumes 1%-2% of the total energy worldwide \cite{kyriakou_electrochemical_2020}.
In the ammonia production process, hydrogen production consumes most of the energy in the endothermic steam methane reforming reaction \cite{kyriakou_electrochemical_2020}.
