	abstract = {Ammonia, produced via the Haber-Bosch (HB) process, is globally the leading chemical in energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. In ammonia plants, hydrogen is generated by steam-methane reforming (SMR) and watergas shift (WGS) and, subsequently, is puriﬁed for the high-pressure ammonia synthesis. Herein, we demonstrate how these steps are integrated into a single BaZrO3-based protonic ceramic membrane reactor (PCMR), operating at atmospheric pressure. Hydrogen generation occurs on a Ni-composite electrode, while VN-Fe is the ammonia synthesis electrocatalyst. Hydrogen extraction from the reforming compartment enhances the thermodynamically limited methane conversions, whereas 5\%–14\% of the pumped protons are converted to ammonia. An electrochemical HB is designed by combining this PCMR with a protonic ceramic fuel cell to recover electricity and separate nitrogen from ambient air by exploiting by-product hydrogen. This process could potentially require less energy and release less carbon dioxide emissions than its conventional counterpart, holding promise for sustainable decentralized applications.},

	abstract = {Based upon laboratory high temperature electrolysis experiments with single cells and serial connected electrolysis cells a concept for scaling up the system for technical applications is presented. It is shown that with regard to the specific properties of ceramic materials a tubular geometry for the electrolysis cells will be most appropriate. In contrast to flat plate cells, tubular cells can easily be connected in series with respect to electrical current as well as gas flow. A scheme for the integration of electrolysis tubes into modules and large scale electrolysis plants will be presented. With respect to the process engineering of an industrial electrolysis plant, it is shown that a near term realization is possible, without high temperature heat sources, by a slightly exothermic operation of the electrolysis cells.},
