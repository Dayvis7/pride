\section{Conclusions}

In this work we demonstrated the \texttt{RAVEN} tool's scenario generation
capability. We have also demonstrated that \acrlong{ESN} can
powerfully predict the evolution of dynamic, chaotic, systems as others have
\cite{pathak_model-free_2018,wikner_combining_2020,bianchi_reservoir_2020}.
Accurate predictions of chaotic systems, like wind energy production, will
enable nuclear power plants to maintain their economic feasibility.
Knowledge, in advance, of renewable electricity generation will enable
operators to ramp the reactor power within the constraints given by reactor
physics. Future work will include identifying ideal input vectors, grid
searches and random searches to tune hyperparameters, and averaging over
several reservoirs, to achieve further
improvements. \acrshort{ESN}s will also be used to predict solar and wind
energy production.
