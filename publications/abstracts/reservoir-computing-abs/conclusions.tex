\section{Conclusions}

In this work we demonstrated the \texttt{RAVEN} tool's scenario generation
capability. Ott et. al and others have shown that reservoir computing can be a
powerful method for predicting the evolution of dynamic, chaotic, systems
\cite{pathak_model-free_2018,wikner_combining_2020,bianchi_reservoir_2020}.
Accurate predictions of chaotic systems, like wind energy production, will
enable nuclear power plants to maintain their economic feasibility.
Knowledge, in advance, of renewable electricity generation will enable
operators to ramp the reactor power within the constraints given by reactor
physics.
