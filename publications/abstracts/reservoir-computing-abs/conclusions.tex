\section{Conclusions}

We demonstrated that even a basic \gls{ESN} can
predict the evolution of a dynamic system, such as electricity demand, like
others have
\cite{pathak_model-free_2018,wikner_combining_2020,bianchi_reservoir_2020}.
More work needs to be done to improve prediction accuracy for the purpose of
load following with nuclear power plants. In the future we will use \glspl{ESN}
to forecast solar and wind electricity production. We will also explore the
impact of training length and network size on accuracy. Finally, we must
determine an optimum set of input values for net demand prediction. These values
might include temperature, wind speed, air pressure, and irradiance because of
possible interactions among this data that could influence electricity
production from renewable sources.
