\begin{enumerate}
  \item Background on the Illinois Climate Action Plan
  \item Background on the UIUC microgrid
  \begin{itemize}
    \item District heating
    \item Solar farms
    \item Wind PPA
    \item Building standards
  \end{itemize}
  \item The university is sometimes willing to pay a premium for clean energy when
  funds are available as evidenced by the investment in solar energy. However,
  university decision makers will favor the lowest cost path forward. The iCAP
  serves to guide policy decisions, but ultimately does not enforce them.
  \item The UIUC microgrid serves as an interesting model for decarbonization
  because of its reliance on a series of steam tunnels for heating. Natural gas
  and fossil fuels are the only competitor for nuclear with regard to reliable
  and efficient production of heat and steam. Due to this, it seems unlikely that
  UIUC will be able to decarbonize by deploying a fully renewable energy system.
