# 2020-dotson-optimal-sizing
This repository holds the data analysis, figures, that will lead to quantitative recommendations for the optimal reactor size.

Multiple scenarios will be addressed: 

1. The reactor itself is free (significant reduction in capital cost). 
2. The reactor still has a price tag and higher capital cost.
3. Increasing penetration of variable renewable energy sources.
4. Add grid flexibility in the form of H2 and thermal storage.

## Timeline (approximate):
2/14/20 : The optimal reactor size for scenario one (basic recommendation).
