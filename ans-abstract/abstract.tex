\section{Introduction}

The electric grid is important to decabonize in order to reach out carbon goals and halt climate change
(mention Icap see \cite{holcomb_fueling_2015}).
Unfortunately, as we have seen with France that alone will not be enough. Around 40\% (find reference and more accurate numbers) of France's CO$_2$ is from transportation.
Micro-reactors present a solution to this problem by producing clean H$_2$ and heat for use in other industrial processes.
