\section{Results}

Current results include typical time series for quantities of interest. Namely steam demand, electric demand, and power produced by VRE. We have also generated synthetic data for grid demand and solar power using the \texttt{trainARMA} function in \texttt{RAVEN}. Thus the first step of the methodology from Baker et. al has been completed.
