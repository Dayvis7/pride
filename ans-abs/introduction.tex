\section{Introduction}

There has been significant work recently to develop energy system concepts that incorporate a mixture of nuclear energy, variable renewable energy (VRE) and energy storage techniques. These systems are often referred to as nuclear hybrid energy systems (NHES). These systems are generally robust, reliable, economically appealing, and have low to zero greenhouse gase (GHG) emissions \cite{baker_optimal_2018,ruth_nuclear-renewable_2014,ruth_economic_2016,suman_hybrid_2018-1}. In 2015, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) made a commitment to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 in the Illinois Climate Action Plan (iCAP) \cite{isee_illinois_2015}. Nuclear energy was identified as a potential contributor to this goal. In this work we will be using the \texttt{RAVEN} framework to find the optimal size for a micro-reactor that would minimize the levelized cost of electricity for the UIUC embedded grid.
